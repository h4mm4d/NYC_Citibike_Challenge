At figure:1 we can see that most rides are under 10 minutes and rarely if any rides last over an hour. This tells us most people are just using to get around the nighborhood and a very few for recreational usage as for that purpose ride would have last longers. Therefore having stations in densly populated area with most amanities close by would be benficial. This is a fact that Citibike should keep in mind when they exapnd locations.
