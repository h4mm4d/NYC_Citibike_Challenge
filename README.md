## overview
Citibike lets people rent bike in Newyorkcity. Each month the data is collected on the usage of bikes. In this challenge I analyzed data using Tableau for August, 2019. Overall,

At figure: 1 we can see that most rides are under 10 minutes and rarely, if any rides last over an hour. This tells us most people are just using to get around the neighborhood and a very few for recreational use as for that purpose ride would have last longers. Therefore, having stations in densely populated areas with most amenities close by would be beneficial. This is a fact that Citibike should keep in mind when they expand locations.

From the figure above we can see the peak hours are in between 4:00PM to 7:00PM. Best time to do maintenance work on Bikes is between 3:00 AM to 6:00 AM.

The overwhelming majority of customers are men. Citibikes needs strategy to attract women customers and subscribers as well.

Highest usage is during weekday rush hour traffic. This tells us that people are using bikes to commute to work. Most likely these are people living outside city took a train (or bus) to the city and then used bikes to get to their destination.

[Tableu Link for Figure 5:](https://public.tableau.com/views/Module14ChallengeTripsbyGender/TripsbyGenderWeekdaysperHour?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
While it shows that men and women use similar pattern, the overwhelming majority of those riders are men.

[Tableu Link for Figure 6:](https://public.tableau.com/views/Module14ChallengeGenderByWeekDays/GenderByWeekdays?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
The biggest group of customers are men a who are subscribers and they use the mostly during weekends.

Most of Citibike customers are renting from southern part of Manhattan.

[Tableu Link for Figure 8:](https://public.tableau.com/views/Dashboaredpopularlocations/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
This is a comparison between starting and ending locations where of rides for the month was over 10,000 for the month of August. There are 16 starting locations and 12 ending locations in this list. While all 12 top ending locations were also in a top starting location, there were starting locations that has much less bikes ending up there. This tells us that in certain location bikes need to be moved to keep it full as traffic is usually going in only directions.  




## Summary
The tableau is a powerful and simple to use tool that can give a lot of insight on a large set of data. In this assignment, it was discovered 
1. The biggest group of customer for Citibike are men who are using Citibikes to help with the commute. 
2. Not all bike returns to the location where it was borrowed.
