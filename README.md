At figure:1 we can see that most rides are under 10 minutes and rarely if any rides last over an hour. This tells us most people are just using to get around the nighborhood and a very few for recreational usage as for that purpose ride would have last longers. Therefore having stations in densly populated area with most amanities close by would be benficial. This is a fact that Citibike should keep in mind when they exapnd locations.

From figure above we can see th peak hours are in between 4:00PM to 7:00PM. Best time to do maintaince work on Bikes is between 3:00 AM to 6:00 AM.

Highest usage are during weekdays rush hour trafic. This tells us that people are using bikes to commute to work. Most likely these are people living outside city took a train (or bus) to the city and then used bikes to get to their desitnation.

While it shows that men and women use similar pattern, overwhelming mejority of those riders are men.

Most of Citibike customers are renting from southern part of Manhatten.

[Tableu Link for Figure 8:](https://public.tableau.com/views/Dashboaredpopularlocations/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
This is a comparison between starting and ending locations where of rides for the month was over 10,000 for the month of August. There are 16 starting locations and 12 ending locations in this list. While all 12 top ending locations were also in top starting location there were starting locations that has much less bikes ending up there. This tells us that in certain location bikes need to be moved to keep it full as traffic is usally going in only directions.
